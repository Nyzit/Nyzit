### **`🔎Let's go more in-depth🔍`**
Why did I decide to create Nook? Maybe because I don't trust other people, but who knows?

The goal of Nook was to take the ideas in my imagination and make them a reality for others to use, starting with Nook-Bar.

I looked at my desktop and thought, "Why don't I just do it "myself" " I got to work and made the macOS menu bar on Windows. I was first using C++, but because I wanted the settings to have a more modern look, I wanted to switch to C#, which didn't work pretty well.
It used more resources, and it was just weird. After a sleep with thoughts on how I can fix the bar, I turned on my PC just to see that all my icons are GONE, so I tried to troubleshoot it, and after 2 hours, I just used a system restore point from 5 days ago. After that, I just switched back to C++, but when i have a stable fully functional product, I'm planning on switching it to Rust, but that's not the point of this text. So after making a relatively stable and working Nook-bar, I decided to put it up on GitHub to share it with others, and I just thought, I'm so f**ing smart. So I went in, created a GitHub account, and uploaded that to a new repository, which, to even upload, took like 30 minutes of research and watching YouTube videos.

That's the story of Nook and Nook-Bar, but I still want to create much more Nook stuff, so I'm hyped for the future, and I hope you are too. 🤩
